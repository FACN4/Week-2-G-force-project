# what:

Build a to-do-list app. user stories as followed:

- a to-do editor.

- enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them

- view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day

- mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left

- the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb

# why:

- to help plan any user on a day-to-day baises.

# how:

at first we worked together to understand the dom and what was happening in the code. then we split the tasks :

- css :- ben and sol.
- coverage testing :- noor aka Mr.Bubbles.

git flow: efficient but not frequent.
